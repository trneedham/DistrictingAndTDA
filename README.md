# DistrictingAndTDA

Material for the breakout sessions on Topological Data Analysis at the Voting Rights Data Institute, 2019. These sessions were run jointly with Moon Duchin and Thomas Weighill.

This includes slides for lectures covering basics of TDA, which contain some overlap day-to-day because the sessions were meant to be relatively self-contained. There are also handouts containing activities for students to work on together in class. Finally, there are Jupyter notebooks giving some TDA software demonstrations. The final Jupyter notebook consists of applications of TDA to the redistricting problem.
